        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Body of Squid is often called ‘Squid Tube’ and available from any supermarket stores. I always wonder why they don’t sell tentacles. Frozen Squid Tentacles are available from most Asian grocery stores and they are not expensive. Of course, fresh whole squid from seafood stores are the best. They will clean them for you. This is my favourite way to cook Squid Tentacles. Absolutely delicious!!!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>500g Squid Tentacles</li>
            <li>1 thumb size piece Ginger *grated</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons Soy Sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Mirin</li>
            <li>1/4 cup Potato Starch Flour</li>
            <li>1/4 cup Plain Flour</li>
            <li>Oil for frying</li>
            <li>hichimi (Japanese Chilli Spice Mix) *optional</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Clean the Squid Tentacles and cut into pieces.</li>
