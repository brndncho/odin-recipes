            <li>200g Crab Leg Meat or Canned Crab Meat</li>

            <li>4 Large Dried Shiitake Mushroom, resuscitated, julienned (optional)</li>
            <li>1L Chicken Broth or homemade stock</li>
            <li>500ml water</li>
            <li>2 Slices of Fresh Ginger</li>
            <li>3 Egg Whites</li>
            <li>½ tsp Ground White Pepper and more for serving</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
            <li>4 Stalks of Green Onions, cut in half</li>
            <li>Finely Chopped Green Onions for garnish</li>
            <li>Fresh Cilantro for garnish</li>
            <li>Chinese red vinegar 大红浙醋 for serving</li>
            <li>Corn Starch Slurry - 3tbsp Corn starch and 4 tbsp of water</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Dried scallops do not need to be resuscitated overnight, unlike dry fish maw or dried Chinese mushrooms. Soak the dried scallops in water until softened before cooking.</li>
            <li>And chicken broth, water and ginger slices in a large stock pot over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Add rehydrated and parboiled fish maw.</li>
            <li>Add crab meat to the pot of water. Mix well.</li>
            <li>Add white ground pepper to the pot to remove any fishy smell from the fish maw.</li>
            <li>Once the fish maw and crab soup starts boiling, slowly add cornstarch water to the pot. Mix well until it thickens and reaches the desired viscosity.</li>
            <li>Add beaten egg whites to the soup slowly to create beautiful egg ribbons, fluffy swirls and flower-like patterns.</li>
            <li>Add a pinch of salt to taste.</li>
            <li>Serve in a large bowl along with a side of extra ground white pepper and Chinese red vinegar (大红浙醋), and a few slices of ginger.</li>
        </ol>
