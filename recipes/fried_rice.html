        <p> <em>Imagine hot-off-the-wok fluffy stir fried rice</em> with ingredients such as chicken, shrimp, egg, pork, mixed vegetables with fried rice seasoning of soy sauce, fish sauce and oyster sauce. It’s delicious!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Leftover steamed rice.</li>
            <li>Minced garlic.</li>
            <li>Protein: chicken, pork, shrimp, egg. You can use either one, or you can use a combination of any of them. It’s totally up to you and what you like.</li>
            <li>Frozen mixed vegetables: carrots, green beans and corns.</li>
            <li>Seasonings: soy sauce, fish sauce, oyster sauce, ground white pepper and salt.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat up a wok or pan with the oil. Add the garlic and stir-fry until aromatic, follow by the chicken, shrimp, and mixed vegetables. Stir-fry until the chicken and shrimp are half cooked.</li>
            <li>Add in the rice and stir well with the ingredients. Add the fish sauce, soy sauce, oyster sauce, white pepper and continue to stir the fried rice for a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li>Using the spatula, push the rice to the side of the wok and make a "well" in the middle of the fried rice. Pour the beaten eggs in the "well." Wait for 30 seconds and then cover the eggs with the fried rice.</li>
            <li>Leave it for 30 seconds to 1 minute and continue to stir-fry, so the eggs form into small pieces and mix well with the fried rice. Add salt to taste and do some quick stirs, dish out and serve hot.</li>
        </ol>
